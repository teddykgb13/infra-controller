EXAMPLES:

List boot-interface candidates for a machine and the picks among them:
    $ nico-admin-cli boot-interface candidates 12345678-1234-5678-90ab-cdef01234567

As JSON (the global --format flag):
    $ nico-admin-cli --format json boot-interface candidates 12345678-1234-5678-90ab-cdef01234567

Tip: hand a candidate to 'boot-interface set' by its MAC or Interface UUID column.
