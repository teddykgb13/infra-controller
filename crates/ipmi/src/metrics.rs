//! Attempt counters for the IPMI reset commands. A `restart` may issue up to
//! two commands -- the DPU legacy raw reset, then the chassis power reset --
//! and an intermediate failure used to vanish: collected into a `Vec` whose
//! entries were then dropped. Counting every command execution by command
//! and outcome makes those attempts and failures visible, without an
//! attempt-index label (attempt counts are unbounded; the totals are the
//! signal). The event is metric-only (`log = off`), matching the sites'
//! existing logging: a final failure still propagates to callers, and the
//! intermediate ones stay out of the logs as before.
